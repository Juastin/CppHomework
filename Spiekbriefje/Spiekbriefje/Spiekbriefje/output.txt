Bernardo If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
** Enter Horatio and Marcellus
Horatio Friends to this ground.
Bernardo What, is Horatio there?
Horatio A piece of him.
Bernardo Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Marcellus Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Horatio Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Horatio Well, sit we down,
Horatio And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
